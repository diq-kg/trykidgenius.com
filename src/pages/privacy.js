              This site automatically recognizes visitorsâ€™ domain names and IP
              addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). No
              personal information about you is revealed in this process. The
              Site may also gather "traffic data" that may be helpful for
              marketing purposes or for improving the site in general. The Site
              uses Google Analytics (and other third-party tools) to analyze how
              people use the Site. Information about your visit is collected and
              transmitted to 3rd parties, where it is then analyzed and compiled
              into statistical reports. This information is collected to allow
              content, the service and its marketing to be optimized to better
              meet the needs of customers and the Site.
