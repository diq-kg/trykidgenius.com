## How You Can Update Your Daycare in an Instant!

The month of March in 2020 will always be a time that lives in infamy around the world. Surely to be a story that kids will grow up and tell their own kids about; it’s hard to believe we are living during a world wide shutdown due to Covid-19. Millions of people stayed home to raise their family and keep safe in order to protect their health and the well-being of others. Slowly, as the world starts to come back to life, and work can resume again, things are going to look much differently. As a daycare owner, now more than ever is the time to invest and learn about online management to assist with various Covid restrictions! Here are some reasons why moving fully online can help you during these trying times.

### Attendance

As a daycare owner, you want to monitor attendance carefully. It allows you to review your enrollment on a daily basis and touch base at home when a child is absent to check on them. It helps also with keeping track with drop ins, part time, and full time enrollment to make sure parents are being charged accordingly and you have all your ducks in a row if and when the state monitors your attendance. When you have attendance online, you can view all children on one page, rather than flipping through multiple charts and put yourself at risk of contamination or even losing these important records.

### Announcements

If you have adjusted hours, need to make announcements about masks, new sanitizing procedures, or even drop off or pick up changes, you don’t have to post gaudy signs or worry about making phone calls. When you move your facility fully online, there is only one place for parents to look and it requires you to make one post, saving you tons of time and allowing you to keep records of all announcements on a virtual bulletin board style set up. This can also be helpful when being monitored by the state to show them that parents are being kept in the loop of all changes and updates so they can be in the know and abide by any standards set forth.Compliance and cooperation is key.

### Messaging

We make it easy to communicate directly with parents over text messages without giving out your personal phone number! When you have an in-app messenger set up, you not only can quickly contact parents, but they can contact you. This generates a message history that can be saved and placed into an electronic file, which is easy to pull out at any time and reference. If a child or parent becomes ill or has special orders from a physician, or even if they need to make changes to permission forms, a messaging feature will save you tons of time and plenty of paper.

### Daily Reports and Progress Reports

If and when you need to send reports to the state to demonstrate how your center is equipped to deal with mandatory guidelines and procedures, you can generate a daily report of how your center is operating. Other staff members can access the system, in addition to yourself, allowing for an “all hands on deck approach.” You can also do this for parents to show them how often hand washing breaks occur, when your child is moved from one room to another, and approximately how many children they’re grouped with at any given time. You can even outline how the handling of food occurs, as well as input personal notes about a child in case they need to be seen by a physician or are in need of supplies.

[KidGenius](https://trykidgenius.com) is an easy way to manage a daycare. It has a number of features that cover each of the areas above and allow for paper-less contact. While you may not agree with the policies and procedures put into place, it’s important to operate the most organized and safest business possible that puts the health and well-being of your employees and children first. Life is hard right now, but running your business shouldn’t be. Give this affordable and easy to use app a try to keep you cool, calm, and collected during these Covid days.
