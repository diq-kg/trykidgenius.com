Some rules of thumb to follow with budgeting

![daycare software](daycare-software.jpg "daycare software")

Evidently, you need more than a software solution to run your daycare center. Some items you will need to budget monthly are suggested by the various applications available in the available software solutions.

Your budget is broken up between income and expenses. You make a profit if your income is higher than your expenses, and unfortunately, you will experience negative profit if your income isn’t higher than your expenses.

Your income consists of tuition paid by parents and fees from subsidized childcare. The expense list is a bit longer, and it includes salaries, bills, taxes, food costs, insurance, supplies, and the mortgage payment or rental for the center. Lastly, another rule of thumb is, “If it isn’t in the budget, then don’t purchase it.”
